//The player's main stats: knowledge::mage, might::warrior, trickery::rogue,
//depravity::cultist. maxHealth is determined by class: mage/cultist/student 20,
//rogue 30, warrior 40. The correspondence between the jobs and their relevant stats
//is deliberate, in case we want to use unscoped enum equality in some capacity.
